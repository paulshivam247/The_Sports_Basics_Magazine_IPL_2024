Detailed Project Description: IPL 2024 Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive data-driven analysis of IPL seasons from 2021 to 2023, aimed at predicting key trends and top performers for IPL 2024. Using Power BI, I have analyzed various aspects of the game, including batting, bowling, and match performances, to derive meaningful insights. The goal is to provide IPL fans, analysts, teams, and fantasy cricket players with data-backed predictions and engaging statistics.

The insights generated from this project are featured in Sports Basics Magazine, helping readers go beyond surface-level stats and truly understand the trends shaping IPL 2024.

Approach & Methodology
Understanding the Dataset

Worked with four key datasets:
dim_match_summary ‚Äì Match details (teams, winner, margin, date, match ID).
fact_batting_summary ‚Äì Batting performance (runs, balls, 4s, 6s, SR, dismissal).
fact_bowling_summary ‚Äì Bowling stats (wickets, overs, economy, maidens, runs conceded).
dim_players ‚Äì Player attributes (team, role, batting/bowling style).
Cleaned and structured the data to ensure accuracy in analysis.
Building Insights & Visualizations

Identified top performers for the Orange Cap (most runs) and Purple Cap (most wickets).
Analyzed strike rates, economy rates, boundary %, and match-winning contributions.
Examined team trends and their consistency across seasons.
Created leaderboards and interactive dashboards for a visually engaging analysis.
Predictions for IPL 2024

Based on past data trends, predicted top run-scorers and wicket-takers.
Analyzed playoff teams, finals contenders, and potential champions.
Provided insights useful for fantasy cricket players and analysts.
